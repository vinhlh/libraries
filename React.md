# React.js from scratch

## Recommendation
* Do not care about Boilerplates/ Starter Kits, just do it by yourself from scratch.

Things you have to know:
* React.
* ES6 - a newer version of Javascript.
* Webpack - In case you need code splitting.
* Flux/ Redux - another web application's architecture.
